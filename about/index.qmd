# Hey, it's good to see you here!

Thanks for taking the time to get to know me. My name is Zachary Lorico Hertz and I am a third-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. I study how identities develop, are expressed through political behavior, and intersect with power in local politics. In my research, I use causal inference methods, geocoded large-N observational data, and original survey data to study the effects an increasingly diverse and partisan electorate will have on representation and sub-national institutions. My writing has been featured in academic and popular outlets, including the Election Law Journal and the Washington Post. 

Currently, I am the Programming and Data Manager at the [Berkeley IGS Poll](https://igs.berkeley.edu/research/berkeley-igs-poll). Previously, I worked as an Analyst at Data for Progress, where I fielded and analyzed polling data for a number of clients in progressive politics. In addition to my academic research, I have done independent political consulting for Groundwork Project, Data for Progress, and private clients. I received an M.A. from the University of Chicago, and a B.A. from Tufts University. I also write poetry, with work forthcoming in [Yearling](https://workhorsewriters.com/feedback/), [LEON Literary Magazine](https://leonliteraryreview.com/), and [Eulogy Press](https://eulogy.press/#read).

While much of my time is devoted to reading, writing, or coding, I enjoy hiking, quiz bowl, and both performing and producing music in my spare time. I am in a band with other Ph.D. students called [Good Bones](https://www.instagram.com/goodbones_band/), named for [the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/89897/good-bones) by Maggie Smith (no, not that one). Send me an email and let's talk more!
